# Asprezza Analyzer
Repository containing code for the new tool Asprezza Analyzer as described in chapter 9.6 of Sascha Resch's doctoral thesis at LMU Munich

# Main goal of the application
The application was built in order to analyze phoentic asprezza in (Old) Italian verse texts. The texts to be analyzed must be in TEI XML format. The analysis can be easily adjusted as the rules to identify and quantitatively measure phonetic asprezza can be adjusted at runtime of the application.

# Prerequisities
Asprezza analyzer was implemented using .NET Framework 4.7.2 using Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition) and the programming language C#. Thus. in order to install the programm you need to install .NET 4.7.2 on your (Windows) machine. If you use the setup MSI-file published in this repository, the setup programme should take care of this and other prerequisities such as programming libraries.

# Further development/Roadmap
- Update to recent .NET framework 4.8
- Update from Windows Form to WPF framework
- Implement further (statistical) calculations --> can be done after the validity of the software has been discussed by the academic community
- Improve error handling, implement error logger
- Implement comparison window to compare asprezza of two texts or two textual portions
- Implement different visualization, maybe spatial heat map
- ...
